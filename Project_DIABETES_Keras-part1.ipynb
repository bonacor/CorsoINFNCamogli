    "   * Models in Keras are defined as a **sequence of layers**\n",
    "   * We create a **Sequential** model and **add layers** one at a time until we are happy with the NN topology.\n",
    "   * The first thing to get right is to ensure the **input layer** has the right number of inputs.\n",
    "      * here we have 8 features, so pass 8 as nb dimensions in the input layer\n",
    "   * How many **hidden layers**? Which type?\n",
    "      * This is admittedly a very hard question. There are heuristics that we can use and often the best network structure is found through a process of trial and error experimentation. Generally, you need a network large enough to capture the structure (a.k.a. complexity) of the problem if that helps at all.\n",
    "      * In this example: we will use a Fully-Connected NN structure with 1 hidden layer only\n",
    "   * Implementation: FC layers are defined using the Keras **Dense** class. We can:\n",
    "      * use it for as many hidden layer as we want (here: 3, i.e. 1 input, 2 hidden, 1 output - read below)\n",
    "      * for each, specify the number of neurons, using the first argument\n",
    "      * specify the activation function, using the activation argument (here: rectifier (**relu**) activation function on the first two layers and the **sigmoid** activation function in the output layer. \n",
    "         * *NOTE: It used to be the case that sigmoid and tanh activation functions were preferred for all layers. These days, better performance is seen using the rectifier activation function. We use a sigmoid activation function on the output layer to ensure our network output is between 0 and 1 and easy to map to either a probability of class 1 or snap to a hard classification of either class with a default threshold of 0.5*.\n",
    "         \n",
    "We can piece it all together by defining layers and adding them. We build a NN with:\n",
    "   * a first hidden layer with 12 neurons that expects 8 input variables (e.g. input dim=8)\n",
    "   * a second hidden layer with 8 neurons\n",
    "   * the output layer with 1 neuron to predict the class (onset of diabetes or not)"
